Snabb Switch is an open source virtual Ethernet switch for cloud
networks. The defining characteristics of Snabb Switch are:

- Simple: Compiles to a small self-contained firmware image.
- Convenient: Runs on the hypervisor host.
- Understandable: Source code that you can read on your kindle.
- High speed & low latency: Direct (kernel bypass) NIC and VM access.

Snabb Switch is a new project that is under active development. The
firmware is not yet ready for deployment, but you are welcome to get
involved in the development.
