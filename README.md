Snabb Switch is an open source virtual Ethernet switch for cloud networks. The defining characteristics of Snabb Switch are:

- Simple: Compiles to a small self-contained firmware image.
- Convenient: Executes as a Linux process or as a virtual machine.
- Understandable: Source code that you can read on your kindle.
- Low latency: Optimized network device drivers built in (kernel bypass).
- High performance: Direct hypervisor network integration (kernel bypass).
- Open and honest: Transparent open source development process.
- Dependable: Commercially supported by <a href="http://www.snabb.co/">Snabb</a> for high-end users.

Snabb Switch is a new project that we are busy developing. The firmware is not yet ready for deployment, but you can follow the development online or visit the <a href="http://www.snabb.co/">Snabb</a> website to subscribe to major announcements.
