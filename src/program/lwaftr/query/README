Display current statistics from lwAftr counters for a running Snabb instance
with <pid>. If <pid> is not supplied and there is only one Snabb instance,
"query" will connect to that instance.

The values for the counters defined in <src/apps/lwaftr/lwaftr.lua> will be
displayed, but only the ones that are not zero.
