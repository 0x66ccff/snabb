Snabb Switch is an open source virtual Ethernet switch for cloud networks. The defining characteristics of Snabb Switch are:

- Compiles to a small self-contained firmware image for simplicity.
- Executes as a Linux process or as a virtual machine for convenience.
- Easy to read source code that you can understand.
- Built-in network device drivers for minimum latency.
- Direct hypervisor integration for maximum performance.
- Open and transparent development process for clarity and honesty.
- Commercially supported by <a href="http://www.snabb.co/">Snabb</a> for high-end users.

Snabb Switch is a new project that we are busy developing. The firmware is not yet ready for deployment, but you can follow our the development online or visit the <a href="http://www.snabb.co/">Snabb</a> website to subscribe for major announcements.
