First create the test traces:
$ snabb maketraces .
| Creating failloop.cap
| Creating faildrop.cap
| Creating failforward.cap
| Creating failflood.cap
| Creating passall.cap

This shouldn't fail:

$ snabb checktrace passall.cap

These should all fail:

$ snabb checktrace failloop.cap
| loop failed on port 0
? 1

$ snabb checktrace faildrop.cap
| drop failed on packet from 0
? 1

$ snabb checktrace failforward.cap
| forward failed, expected to 0
? 1

$ snabb checktrace failflood.cap
