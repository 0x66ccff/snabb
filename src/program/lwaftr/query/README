Usage:
  query [OPTIONS] [<pid>] [<counter-name>]

Options:

  -h, --help                    Print usage information.
  -l, --list-all                List all available counter names.

Display current statistics from lwAftr counters for a running Snabb instance
with <pid>. If <pid> is not supplied and there is only one Snabb instance,
"query" will connect to that instance.

If <counter-name> is set, only counters partially matching <counter-name> are
listed.

The values for the counters defined in <src/apps/lwaftr/lwaftr.lua> will be
displayed, but only the ones that are not zero.
