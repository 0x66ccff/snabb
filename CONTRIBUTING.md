Whenever you create a Pull Request (PR), a maintainer will self-assign
themselves as the *upstream*. The upstream decides if your PR is accepted and
might require you to amend additional changes before merging. You can expect
the upstream to communicate clearly if there are any issues preventing your PR
from being merged, and how they can be fixed. Once merged, the upstream will
add the `merged` label to your PR.

You can also submit PRs that are not ready to be merged: include the labels
`[wip]` in the title of PRs that require further work, and `[sketch]` for PRs
that are not meant to be merged at all.

Please cross reference related issues and PRs extensively by mentioning them in
descriptions or comments (#XXX), as it helps maintainers to read up on related
information.
